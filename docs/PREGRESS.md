## Technical Decisions & Rationale

### Why Google AI SDK?

- Official support and maintenance
- Better integration with Gemini features
- Automatic handling of streaming, retries, and errors
- Type-safe interfaces with full IDE support

### Architecture Choices

- **Async-first**: All I/O operations use asyncio for better concurrency
- **Modular design**: Clear separation between MCP protocol, Gemini integration, and business logic
- **Caching layer**: Reduces API costs and improves response times
- **Progressive loading**: Optimizes token usage by loading context on-demand

### Context Management Strategy

1. **Smart Chunking**: Respects code boundaries (functions, classes) when splitting
2. **Overlap Windows**: Maintains context continuity between chunks
3. **Relevance Scoring**: Prioritizes most relevant code sections
4. **Token Budgeting**: Allocates tokens optimally between context and generation

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Successfully process 1M+ token codebases
- [ ] < 5s response time for most operations
- [ ] 90%+ cache hit rate for repeated queries
- [ ] Zero data loss during context chunking
- [ ] Seamless integration with Claude Code workflow
